# Firewall
I used UBUNTU 20.10 has my firewall and added 4 interfaces.The 4 interfaces are running on CENT OS LINUX with specified ip addresses.  If i ping from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.2.100 The 192.168.1.100 sends a packet from interface 1 and the firewall(ubuntu) will unpack the ip header and check for the destination ip address and forward it to the specific Interface. I have disabled the default ip forwarding in my UBUNTU MACHINE using 'sysctl -w net.all.forwarding = 0'. Furthermore, I tested by blocking the ip address from interface 1 (ip address) to interface 2 (ip address) icmp ping traffic and it successfully Denied.
